# Introduction 📋

- This website is completely built on `MERN` stack (MongoDB + Express.js + React.js + Node.js).
- I worked on the frontend of this website i.e. [Triponvo](https://www.triponvo.com/) during my internship with Kylo Apps.
- This website has very complex features like realtime notifications, chat application for user and influencer, payment gateway and many more.

# Methodology

There is an influencer who would upload itinerary of the places he is an expert of and the users can buy the itinerary for the destinations they want to visit or can get a custom itinerary made for themselves. There are 2 separate views for the website one for the influencer and one for the user. The influencer can add itineraries and destinations he is an expert of and can chat or schedule a meeting with people who buy custom itineraries from him. The user can save the destinations he wants to visit and look at all the videos, photos, blogs uploaded by the user.
The realtime notifications feature is implemented with the help of firebase. I have also fetched videos from youtube api in the app and photos from google api.
